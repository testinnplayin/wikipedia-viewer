This is a programming project that can be found on Free Code Camp at https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer
The idea is to make a webpage that allows a user to type in a search that will return random Wikipedia articles on the subject being searched. The user can then select an article that will take the user to the correct Wikipedia page. This project will be built with Atom and can be found on CodePen at http://codepen.io/testinnplayin/pen/LRNjwd.
